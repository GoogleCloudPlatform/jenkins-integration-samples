# Jenkins Integrations

This repository houses example projects illustrating best practices for running [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) leveraging the integrations published and officially supported by [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/).

## GCP Officially Supported Plugins

*  [GCE](https://github.com/jenkinsci/google-compute-engine-plugin)

The Google Compute Engine (GCE) Plugin allows you to use GCE virtual machines (VMs) with Jenkins to execute build tasks. GCE VMs provision quickly, are destroyed by Jenkins when idle, and offer Preemptible VMs that run at a much lower price than regular VMs.

*  [GKE](https://github.com/jenkinsci/google-kubernetes-engine-plugin)

The Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Plugin allows you to deploy build artifacts to Kubernetes clusters running in GKE with Jenkins.

*  [OAuth](https://github.com/jenkinsci/google-oauth-plugin)

This plugin implements the OAuth Credentials interfaces to surface Google Service Account credentials to Jenkins. 

*  [GCS](https://github.com/jenkinsci/google-storage-plugin)

This plugin provides the “Google Cloud Storage Uploader” post-build step for publishing build artifacts to Google Cloud Storage.

## Sample Projects
